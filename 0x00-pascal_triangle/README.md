#### PASCAL'S TRIANGLE 

This is an algorithm for genrating pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients used mostly in combinatorics, probability and algebra. It is implemented as a substitute for the binomial theorem and poisson distribution. 

### REQUIREMENTS 

Fork the repository for this code. This code was written in 3.10.2, be sure to have a python interpreter of similar version or higher installed. 

### EXECUTION 

This code uses the pairwise function in the itertools module to pair list elements together. See more: [pairwise function](http://https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.pairwise)
` 
    >>> pascal_triangle(3)
    >>> [1]
    ...[1,1]
    ...[1,2,1]
    ...[1,3,3,1]
